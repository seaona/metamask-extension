+This patch ensures that the browser CommonJS bundle is used in Browserify builds.
+
+Prior to `axios@1.13.3`, the `main` entry of `package.json` was set to `index.js`, which was the
+ESM source. But in `axios@1.13.3`, this was updated to point at the Node.js bundle in
+this PR: https://github.com/axios/axios/pull/5756/changes
+
+This effectively resulted in the Node.js bundle being used instead of the ESM source.
+
+To fix this, it has been updated to use the CommonJS browser bundle, which is better suited for
+Browserify anyway (it doesn't support ESM, `axios` needed to be transpiled before).
+
+We can drop this patch when we stop using Browserify, or when Axios fixes this problem (see this
+issue: https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/7357)
